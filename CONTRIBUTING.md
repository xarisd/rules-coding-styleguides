## Want to help improve these guidelines?

### Just open an issue

Really! This is one of the most helpful things to do.

* Something is wrong?
* Something is hurting you eyes?
* Have an idea?
* Have something to say?

Go and [submit an issue](https://github.com/xarisd/rules-coding-styleguides/issues)!

### Want to contribute more than an issue?

I love pull requests!

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a topic branch, do some work, push it, and create a pull request.

#### Things I like

* Nice title and a complete description of what and why in the pull request body.
* Check what is already in the repository to see how you should format things.
* If you are contributing written text, I like the Markdown format.

#### Things to avoid

* Spaces or underscores in filenames (I prefer dashes to separate
  words, but single word filenames are better if possible)
* Don't commit large binary files and if you have to commit smaller
  ones, make sure they are not going to be updated often. For all other cases, it's better to host the file somewhere else and provide a link to it (for example presentations etc.)
