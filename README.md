# Coding Styleguides

Below lie the general and specific guidelines for writing code.

They are seperated according to the following list:

* [General](docs/General.md) rules
* Language Specific Styleguides
  * Ruby
  * JavaScript
  * CoffeeScript
* Back-End Styleguides
  * Rails
* Front-End Styleguides
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Sass

All of the above are simple recommendations...

BUT...

Sometimes (most of the times) I like to **force** them into my projects. They give me and the rest of the team peace of mind regarding the "small stuff" that truly make a difference on the **quality** of the code and the **collaboration** between team members.

So...read, MODIFY and use them according to YOUR needs.
